## My process

I tried a mobile first process.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to use custom properties.

### Continued development

In order to center the component in the page I would have need to add a body height, and then media queries to account for the odd behaviors. Instead I opted to not do it exactly and not give i the height. In the future I'd like to take more time and explore how to get this done in a more responsive way.
